# Image Repository Application

Image repository e-commerce application. Users can browse, create new images, and buy products.

Once logged in, admin users have the ability to delete images.
(Shh... the username is 'Admin' and the password is 'password123' but don't tell anyone!)

Fun fact, all the images in this repository are photos of food that I have cooked or baked!
In addition to developing, I have a passion for all things FOOD.
